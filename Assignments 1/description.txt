The exercises of this week (assignment one) are problem 1 and problem 2.

The first problem is solved via a short c++ program that performs 
the numerical solutions to the function given in ex. 1 on arbitrary 
boundaries, which have to be specified via console input.
When specified as 0.0 and 0.4 the program compares it with the exact solution given on the 
exercise sheet "erf(0.4)". The console application takes the user through 
the steps via instructions in the console. 

Problem 2: a and b are solved on paper and with as little electronic assistance as possible.
The numerical methods which are probed in b are used with a little more than an elaborate
pocket calculator.
The scan of the solutions on paper can be found in the pdf: "Problem 2a,b.pdf".

The additional questions to the coding exercises 2c,d can be found as comments below the text 
files containing the corresponding code.
