        a)
            The derivation of the formula for Widom's method can be found within the document
            "derivation_Widoms_method_Paul_Monderkamp_sheet12.pdf".
        b) 
            The code that is used for this weeks simulations can be found within 
            "WCA_MC_as12.cpp".

            It is mainly identical to the code from exercise sheet. 
            The main difference is constituted by the paragraph inside the if statement for the sampling       
            
            "if (k % (Nsteps/Nsample) == 0)" 
                { 
                    ... 
                }
    
            that begins with 
            "double trial_x = rnm()*sideL;"
            and ends with
            "average_exp_dU += (double)(1.0/Nsample)*exp(-trial_dU/T); "
            which calculates the canonical expected value inside the formula for the excess part of the 
            chemical potential.
        c)
            The plot that is generated from various values for the chemical potential can be found inside
            "mu(t).png".

            The explicit values are given as

            T        mu
