Assignment sheet No. 11:

11.1)
    a)
        The code of the Monte-Carlo Simulation for hard rods in 1 dimension is given in the .txt file
        "GCMC.cpp"
    b)
        The plots for the number of particles as a function of Monte-Carlo steps are given in the 
        files 
        "N(t)_M=1e6_mu=1.png"
        "N(t)_M=1e6_mu=5.png"
        "N(t)_M=1e6_mu=20.png"
        where t stands for the executed number of Monte-Carlo trials and M is the maximum total number of trials. 
        A definition of a Monte-Carlo sweep is rather inconvenient since the total number of particles within the 
        system fluctuates. For the sake of comparability and the consistency of the scaling of the x axes the plots
        are given as a function of Monte-Carlo trial operations rather than sweeps. 

        It can be seen that with rising chemical potential the average number of particles in the 
        system rises and the fluctuations decrease. 
        The former is due to the fact that upon increase of the chemical potential the acceptence probability 
        for insertion of a particle rises whereas for removal it decreases. 

        Due to the fact that upon increasing number of particles in the system the packing fraction increases linearly 
        the possible room for fluctuations of the particle number upwards decreases. 
        The fluctuations of the particle number downwards decreases due to higher probability of greater numbers 
        of particles. 
    c,d)
        The plots for the global densities for different chemical potentials \mu are given in the files
        "dens_M=1e6_mu=1.png"
        "dens_M=1e6_mu=5.png"
        "dens_M=1e6_mu=20.png"    
        All the plots show distinct peaks that correspond to a high probability of a particle residing at that
        particular position.
        Upon increase of the chemical potential the noise in the plots decreases whereas the number of distinct peaks
        increases.    
        This is due to the fact that on average a greater number of particles resides in the system and thus on
        average each particle has physically less space. (In this picture the individual particles do not move, and 
        new configurations are only generated via removal and insertion of particles, but on average each particle has
        less space to reappear and thus the fluctuations in the positions are greater.)
