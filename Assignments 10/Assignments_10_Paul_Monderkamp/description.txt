10.1)

    a) 
        The implementation of the metropolis Monte-Carlo method can be found inside the folder code.
        The square lattice for the initialisation can be found within "init_conf.txt" which is the initialization
        for the molecular dynamic simulation from ex. 7. 
        In this simulation the velocities are not needed.
    b)
        The acceptence rate as a function of different step ranges defined by delta can be observed in the plot
        in 
        
        accrate.jpg

        Additionally the orange plot shows an exponential fit which fits the data in blue to a good approximation.
        The coefficients for the fit function

        acc_rate(delta) =  a*exp(b*delta)

        are 
        a = 1.0359
        b = -4.0794

    c)
        The plots of the mean squared displacements for delta = 0.1, delta = 0.2 can be found within

    d)
        The virtual diffusion coefficient for the delta = 0.2 is equal to 0.1184
        whereas 
        the virtual diffusion coefficient for the delta = 0.1 is equal to 0.0925.
    e)
        The pair corrolation function for the system in the canonical ensemble from exercise 8.1 
        can be observed within 

        g_nose_hoover.png

        The pair corrolation function as measured in the Monte-Carlo simulation can be observed within

        g_from_MC_long.jpg

        It is visible that both graphs represent a reasonable shape for a corrolation function. 
        g(r) from the molecular dynamics simulation shows more noise which may be due to the amount of sampled 
        configurations which are used for the generation of the plots.
