    a) 
        The general definition of a sphere embedded n+1 dimensions is S^n = {x in \mathbb{R}| \norm{x} = r, where r is a real number}. 
        The dimension of the sphere itself is n, due to it being a hypersurface. 
        The interior of the n-sphere, the n+1 ball is defined as B^{n+1} = {x in \mathbb{R}| \norm{x} < r, where r is a real number}.

    b) 
        The volume of a 5-Ball is equal to 0.1644934066848226 according to the formula V_5 = \frac{8*pi^2*R^5}{15}
        According to the Monte-Carlo simulation the volume is equal to 0.164441 with N = 1e8 random points.
