    a) 
        The general definition of a sphere embedded n+1 dimensions is S^n = {x in \mathbb{R}| \norm{x} = r, where r is a real number}. 
        The dimension of the sphere itself is n, due to it being a hypersurface. 
        The interior of the n-sphere, the n+1 ball is defined as B^{n+1} = {x in \mathbb{R}| \norm{x} < r, where r is a real number}.

    b) 
        The volume of a 5-Ball, being the interior of a 4-sphere, a spherical surface embedded in 5 dimensions , is equal to
